# DungeonConquest
A multiplayer dungeon-crawling game where players are split into two groups: Dungeon Masters and Adventurers. The Dungeon Masters (DMs) design and control the dungeon layout, Obstacles (O), Non-Player Characters (NPCs), and Events (E) while the Adventurers navigate through the dungeon, encountering challenges set by the Dungeon Masters.
